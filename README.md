# Project Title
Missing Persons Route Optimisation.

This project is going to use various technologies to assess the nearby terrain where a person went missing to come up with a viable route to rescue the injured/lost party.

## Literature to Consider

To-Do List
- [ ] Draw a bounding box around the summit of Carrauntoohil to set a search area.
- [ ] Make a photogrammetric model of the same area around the summit.
- [ ] Break the bounding box down into a 2d array of coordinates to create a 3d model.
- [ ] Write a 2D Python Array to call the Google Elevation API for each point in the above bounding box.
