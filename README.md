This Repository contains the documentation for my Final Year Project.

# Project Title
Missing Persons Route Optimisation.

This project is going to use various technologies to assess the nearby terrain where a person went missing to come up with a viable route to rescue the injured/lost party.

## Literature to Consider
Actually, as mad as it sounds, Mt. Chilliad from GTA 5 may prove useful as data sets probably already exist. Think 'already completed' model, not a custom approach.
